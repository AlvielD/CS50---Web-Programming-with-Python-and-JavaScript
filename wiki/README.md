# Project 1: Django

The website stores encyclopedia entries that are displayed thanks to markdown code. The files as stored as markdown files and then converted to HTML in order to render them. Such files can be seen [here](https://github.com/AlvielD/CS50---Web-Programming-with-Python-and-JavaScript/tree/main/wiki/entries).

### Initialization of the server

The website can be tryed out by executing the following command on the folder of the project:

    python manage.py runserver
    
Once the server is launched, you should be able to open the loopback IP address that is shown on the terminal on your web browser to see the webpage.

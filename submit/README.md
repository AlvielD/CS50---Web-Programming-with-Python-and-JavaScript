# Project 0: HTML and CSS

The file `index.html` contains the front-end of a google-like front page. To try it out, just open it directly with your default web browser.
The files `images.Search.html` and `advancedSearch.html` contain another two different front pages, one for a images web search enginer and the second for an advance search engine.

The style for the front-end is defined in the files `index.css` and `advancedS.css`.

# Project 2: SQL, Models and Migrations

The interesting part of this project is how the models are used to generate the database. Notice [this](https://github.com/AlvielD/CS50---Web-Programming-with-Python-and-JavaScript/blob/main/commerce/auctions/models.py) folder where all the models are defined.

### Initialization of the server
To initialized the server we have to execute the following command on the folder of the project:
    
    python manage.py runserver
 
Once again, you should be able to visualize the web page by using the loopback IP address showed on the terminal as input in your default web browser.
